# Pojects

This repository is a bunch of self-projects to make my IT life easier and a little bit more fancy.

Since I started working in IT services, I found lots of things that can be improved (automatic functions, visual help...). So I've decided to create my own scripts and also improve the ones that already exist by others (if possible).

I'm currently part of a small script team at my current job and, as some of the scripts that I create/edit are currently used in work-related pages (Trello, LinkedIn, Workday...) I will share the ones are used for public pages.
